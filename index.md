### About me 🏋️ 🖥️
Hi there, I'm Valerio Pizzichini and this is my secret vault.  
I'm a Senior Software Engineer. I love designing and building scalable and distributed applications.

Love to code in TypeScript, Rust and Elixir.

Hybrid athlete on spare time 🏃 More information on this topic to come

### Why this vault? Was it really needed?

Decided to transform my notes, learnings and failures into public posts to share my journey and improve my skills in writing and exposing thoughts in a readable way.
