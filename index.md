## About me
Hi there, I'm Valerio Pizzichini and this is my secret vault.  
I'm a Senior Software Engineer. I love designing and building scalable and distributed applications.

Love to code in TypeScript, React, Rust and Elixir.

Hybrid athlete on spare time üèÉ

## Why this vault? was it really needed?

Decided to transform my notes, learnings and failures (mostly) into public posts to share my journey and improve my skills in writing and exposing thoughts in a readable way.
Probably I will fail at it, so if you want to increase my impostor syndrome level, please contact me at:
